# Dr. K Dopamine Management

Summary of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CWq8wyS90o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CWq8wyS90o)

* Do harder tasks earlier
  * Dopamine is required for sustaining attention.
  * Action throughout the day depletes dopamine.
  * When more dopamine is available - more released - more reinforced
  * The more dopaminergic the activity, the less dopamine is required to engage in it (the less motivation/less energy to get into - thus, gaming and such are so easy to begin) - but they also squeeze out dopamine very quickly.
  * So, if high dopaminergic usage is early, it can quickly deplete it for any other task.
* Increase sense of meaningfulness (lack of meaning can make us prone to addictive dopaminergic behaviors)
* Manage negative emotions (even walking can help)
* Perform conscious value assessment (run through action consequences - slow down, write down (perhaps physically) -- can be a slow process of a shift of subconscious  value assessment)
* Add novelty to healthy habits (cooking, exercising, etc.)
* Add some pain to mix: sometimes (not extreme) pain (e.g., squeezing through during exercise) can improve positive reinforcement.

**Self-Control**

* Maintain conflict-monitoring. Don't suppress internal awareness.
* The more emotions you have to suppress, the worse your self-control.
