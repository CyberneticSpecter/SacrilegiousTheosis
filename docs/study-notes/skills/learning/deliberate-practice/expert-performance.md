# Deliberate Practice

Paper summaries on Expert Performance and deliberate practice for it.

### Summary from  The Great Work

Summary from  [The Great Work of Your Life - Stephen Cope](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Your-Life-Journey/dp/055380751X) on how to conduct deliberate practice

> 1. Sustained and intensive practice of a skill for several hours a day.
> 2. Practice with the specific intention of improving, not just repeating.
> 3. Practice that is sustained in this manner for a matter of years— in most cases as many as ten years.&#x20;
> 4. Practice that includes a particular mechanism by which the results of practice can be evaluated and improved upon in future sessions.
> 5. The intentional development of sophisticated feedback loops— teachers and colleagues commenting on progress; other pairs of expert eyes on the work.
> 6. Appropriate care paid to the essential ingredient of “recovery time” so that there is energy to engage in the same intense practice again the next day.
> 7. A considerable amount of time spent within the so-called “domain of the task.”

### Summary from Various Sources

1. Choose to master something where the genetic odds are in your favor
2. Consider "layering" - creating a skill or art form combining different skills suitable for you if you want to specialize in a niche or create a niche where you can be "top".
3. Deliberate Practice involves stressful concentration intending to improve performance. It's not a "flow" state. It's not mere play and generally not inherently enjoyable. Unlike work, there is no immediate financial incentive (such as salary).&#x20;
4. The degree of mastery is a monotonic function of the accumulated "properly done" (well-rested, non-fatigued) deliberate practice hours (the more, the better).&#x20;
5. Conditions for mastery:
   1. Motivation
   2. Design of the task (account for pre-existing knowledge for correct understanding with brief instruction)
   3. Informative Feedback
   4. Repetitions of the same or similar tasks
6. Feedback is key. Feedback can be gained by designing systematic measurements (how many pages read? How many pull-ups? etc.) and/or from coaches.&#x20;
7. Rest/Recovery is important - limit duration of practice 1-4 hrs per day. Start from smaller durations and increase only after sufficient adaptation for smaller durations. Too much is not necessarily good - it can cause burnout or other issues depending on the skill.&#x20;
   1. Sleep is also important. No training could be better than training under fatigue.
8. Constraints for mastery:
   1. Resources (Financial resources, family support, coaches, etc.)
   2. Effort (\~1-4 hrs per day)
   3. Motivational (without some extrinsic motivation, people generally aren't inclined towards actual deliberate practice)
9. Phases of mastery:
   1. Playful interest
   2. Start Deliberate Practice
   3. Prep for \~10 years (full-time commitment)
   4. Innovate - new knowledge

### Learning Complex Skills

To learn complex skills - focus on specific aspects of the skill for different periods.&#x20;
