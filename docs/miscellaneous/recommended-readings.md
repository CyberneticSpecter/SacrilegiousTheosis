# Recommended Readings

Here, I plan to list my recommended readings on various topics. I plan to update it selectively and thoughtfully based on how well a book meets my standards (the books don't have to be necessarily influential to me to be listed here. I may just list them here because I find them well-written, fluff-free, non-generic, and informative for the public, even if I do not learn anything new from them given prior knowledge; even if I disagree about core points). I am refraining from immediately listing every book I have read that may deserve a listing here. I plan to revisit, re-consider, and then list them.&#x20;

I may remove/replace certain books as time passes - if my views change or I find better alternatives. If there is a book I have read and taken note of but have not listed here - it doesn't mean it's not a good book or that I didn't like it; it just means that it didn't meet my specific standards (don't ask me what that is precisely) well enough to be listed here.&#x20;

## The List

1. [Philosophical Devices: Proofs, Probabilities, Possibilities, and Sets - David Papineau](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Devices-Proofs-Probabilities-Possibilities/dp/0199651736). Decent, cleanly-written, roughly beginner-level introduction of reasoning methods, formal tools for philosophers with a broad coverage.&#x20;
