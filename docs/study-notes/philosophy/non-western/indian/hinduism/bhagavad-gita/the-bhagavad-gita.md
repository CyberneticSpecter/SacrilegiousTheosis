# The Bhagavad Gita

From: [The Bhagavad Gita - Eknath Easwaran](https://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-2nd-Eknath-Easwaran/dp/1586380192)

### Narrative Context

* Arjuna was going to wage war (for reasons). Finds out he have to fight against his own relatives, masters, and uncles. This paralyzes him and confuses him. Unable to act and decide what to do - he asks Krishna -- his charioteer -- for advice. Krishna gives him spiritual lessons and in-between reveals himself as God.
* Eknath (in his commentary) interprets Bhagavad Gita to be inserted into Mahabharata after the fact. He doesn't think that Gita supports "just war"; indeed, there are plenty of recommendations (12:13, 13:27–28, 16:4) for ahimsa (non-violence). Instead the dialogue, in his interpretation, represents an internal struggle - a dialogue between a ordinary person with his deepest (divine) Self (represented as Krishna) within himself (10:20).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             &#x20;

### Metaphysics and Theology

The metaphysics and theology borrows elements from Upanishads and Sankhya philosophy. Gita maintains a Sankhya dualism where there are two distinct ontic things:

* (O1.) The Self (Purusha) - The Atman - The witness - the Knower of the "field"; Pure Consciousness.
* (O2.) The Prakriti - the mind-and-matter "field"

There is, however, a third aspect, besides Purusha/Self/Spirit and Prakriti, that is also mentioned (15:16-19):&#x20;

* (O3.) The Supreme Self - The Godhead

#### O1 (Purusha)

The true Self (Purusha) is said to a detached changeless witness - the enjoyer of the show of prakriti (the changing phenomenal world). It (Purusha) is said to perform no action and neither be touched by any act. Agency and everything happen within Prakriti (13:19-22, 13:29-32, 13:5).

The Self is "unmanifest" (2:23)- the manifest are the objects witnessed by the Self - not the Self itself. The manifest is Prakriti.

#### O2 (Prakriti)

Eknath suggests Prakriti isn't necessarily "things-in-themselves" but the contents of the phenomenal world.&#x20;

> According to Sankhya, the evolution of primordial prakriti into mind and matter begins when the equilibrium of prakriti is disturbed (from introduction)

Prakriti (mind-matter field) constituents:

1. Five areas of sense perception
2. Five elements
3. Five sense organs
4. manas (mind)
5. buddhi (intellect)
6. ahamkara (I-maker)
7. Undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved

Desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, etc., happen in Prakriti/Field (13:5). All agency is said to happen in Prakriti (13:19-22).

Prakriti is the whole of mind-matter ("name-and-form") stuff. Here, mind refers not to the more inclusive notion of mind in Western philosophy (which may include the subject of experience - the Purusha as part of it) but refers to the sum total of mental objects and capacities - eg. conceptualization, thoughts, discrimination, etc. (also broadly categorized as "name"); whereas matter possibly refers to corporeality. So although we see a dualism between Prakriti and Purusha - it's not straightforwardly a mind-matter dualism as we find in Western philosophy -- although if the matter is merely understood as phenomenal objects then even Western philosophers don't maintain a strict dualism. &#x20;

While Eknath seems to take Prakriti as constitutive of phenomenal objects, not things-in-itself, some passages seem to suggest that Prakriti cannot manifest - without the light of the Self/Purusha - suggesting that Prakriti exists in itself (independent of the Self) whereas the phenomenal objects are the union of Self and Prakriti (13:26, 13:33-34).

The exact status of the Prakriti-Purusha dynamic is not super clear given these contrasts.&#x20;

#### O3 (Godhead - the supreme Self)

The Godhead transcends both The Self and The Prakriti - but at the same time it is immanent - it is also The Self of all creatures (10:20) and Prakriti is its "womb" where it plants the seeds for creation and change (14:3-4). Thus, both the Self, and The Prakriti seems to be part of one whole monistic reality of the Supreme Self. The Godhead supports everything (7:6-11). The Godhead is also is time - devourer of all (10:32) and preserver (13:12-15). Brahman (Godhead?) is neither being nor non-being (13:12-15). The Purusha-Prakriti dynamics are parts of the Godhead as a whole. Ultimately, the Godhead is beyond both the changeless (Self) and changing (Prakriti) (15:16-19).

Godhead has an unmanifested essential nature - it's the unmoved mover - unmoved and undisturbed by the movements of Prakriti - unattached from the movements of Prakriti is like the movement of wind in space (9:4-9).&#x20;

#### Interplay among Purusha, Prakriti, and the Supreme Self

Both Purusha and Prakriti are beginningless (13:19-22). Purusha is changeless, and Prakriti is constantly changing. The Supreme is beyond the changing and unchanging (15:16-19). &#x20;

Thus, the Godhead is not a creator in the naive sense of bringing the world to existence from nothing but more of an eternal supporting and causally stirring the Purusha-Prakriti dynamic - here and now, forever and ever since infinity.&#x20;

Manifest things are a product of the union of the knower (Purusha) and the Field (Prakriti) (13:26). The dwelling Self is the source of light - that manifests Prakriti.&#x20;

The commentator Eknath seems to suggest the Purusha is singular behind all creatures taking support from (10:20). But if there is just one Self behind it all, it seems a bit weird to have another Supreme Self behind it. However, quick googling reveals that in Sankhya philosophy (from which Gita largely borrows), the Purusha is plural (different for different individuals) - distinguished from Advaita Vedanta:

[https://iep.utm.edu/sankhya/](https://iep.utm.edu/sankhya/)

> As _puruṣa_ is essentially private for every sentient being, being their true self, there are many irreducibly distinct _puruṣa_-s.&#x20;
>
> \[...]
>
> An important difference between schools of Indian philosophy that recognize _mokṣa_(liberation) as an end is the accepted number of souls. In Buddhism there is no separate soul to be liberated. In Advaita Vedānta, there is one common world-soul, and individuality is a function of the material world only. Sāṅkhya adduces three arguments to prove that there is a separate _puruṣa_ for each individual

This also solves the decombination problem of cosmopsychism ([https://philarchive.org/rec/MILTDP-5](https://philarchive.org/rec/MILTDP-5)).&#x20;

However, although at a level the Purusha are distinct and so is Prakriti distinct from Purusha - it seems ultimately all of is the Godhead itself (sometimes framed as a transcendental entity, sometimes as immanent) - which also serves as the unitary ground of all of Purusha and all of Prakriti. That can be one way to understand (10:20) - that the Godhead is the Self in all individuations.  At the end of the day, this seems to get us closer to Advaita again.&#x20;

Overall, it seems like it can be interpreted as a panentheistic theology (or even panentheism, depending on how we interpret nature).

Ordinary persons are then Selves bound in Prakriti (Chapter 14). The goal is unbinding from Prakriti and finding union with the unmanifest transcendental nature of God. &#x20;

#### Other aspects:

* Elements of actions (17:13-15):
  1. Divine Will
  2. Means
  3. Performance of act
  4. Ego
  5. Body
* Karma: web of cause and effect

> Literally, the Sanskrit karma means something that is done. Often it can be translated as deed or action. The law of karma states simply that every event is both a cause and an effect. Every act has consequences of a similar kind, which in turn have further consequences and so on; and every act, every karma, is also the consequence of some previous karma. (From Introduction)

* Lila - the world as Krishna's play for the desire for companion (doesn't seem explicit in Gita - a latter theology)

> Though the word is not used in the Gita, the idea of the world as Krishna’s lila, his play, became a cherished theme of later Hinduism. Krishna, it is said, created the world in play: just as a child might desire to have companions to play with, Krishna desired companions, and made the world. Krishna participates in the game of life; his divine qualities shine through in the world wherever there is excellence of any kind. He is, he tells Arjuna, the essence of every created thing: the sapidity of water, the brightness of fire, the effort of the spiritual aspirant. This may be what is meant by the vijnana of our title – the mystic’s vision of the divine as present here and now is perhaps the real meaning of the term.

* Cosmology:

Cyclical Cosmology

> As the Day of Brahma dawns, the cosmos comes into being; as the Day comes to an end, the entire creation dies and ceases to exist. Then, for a Night as long as the cosmic Day, the universe rests. It ceases to be – or, rather, it continues only in a subtle, unmanifest form, a dream in the mind of Vishnu, who lies sleeping on the waves of the cosmic ocean. Then, without deviating from the eternal rhythm, the cosmos is reborn when the Night is over. The new universe dawns, and Brahma once again moves into his active, creative Day. (from commentary)

Beyond the perishing cosmos

> There is a state of being, however, that is higher than the perishable cosmos, which is not born and does not die the cosmic death. Here (8:20) it is called simply avyakta, the Unmanifest. This is the supreme goal of all living things, and it is Krishna’s home (8:21). Returning to this final resting place, the soul enters into immortal bliss and is not reborn. (from commentary)

### Soteriological End Goal

1. Escape (moksha) from the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara) (8:14-16).
2. Union with the Godhead - unbinding from Prakriti (overcoming worldliness). (4:10-11, 8:14-16).
3. Attain not just jnana but vijnana

> Ramakrishna says, “One who has merely heard of fire has ajnana, ignorance. One who has seen fire has jnana. But one who has actually built a fire and cooked on it has vijnana.”

The commentator suggests moksha does not lead to a strict union of Self and God but resting of Self in God (Supreme Self) - or the "highest hom in God" unbound from Prakriti:

> Krishna reveals that he transcends not only the world of matter but also the immortal Atman that dwells as the conscious “knower” within all beings. Krishna has said that he is the Atman; but the paradox is that he also transcends the Atman. In this highest aspect Krishna is Ishvara, the cosmic Lord, who abides in his own mystery. The liberated Self enjoys union with Krishna and lives in Krishna’s highest home. But the Self does not become Krishna: the immortal soul, even when liberated from its mortal journeying, does not become God.

### **Guide - The way of life**

What follows is the guide to the soteriological end, according to Gita.&#x20;

Background four yoga:

> 1. In jnana yoga, the yoga of knowledge, aspirants use their will and discrimination to disidentify themselves from the body, mind, and senses until they know they are nothing but the Self.
> 2. The followers of bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, achieve the same goal by identifying themselves completely with the Lord in love; by and large, this is the path taken by most of the mystics of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.
> 3. In karma yoga, the yoga of selfless action, the aspirants dissolve their identification with body and mind by identifying with the whole of life, forgetting the finite self in the service of others.
> 4. And the followers of raja yoga, the yoga of meditation, discipline the mind and senses until the mind-process is suspended in a healing stillness and they merge in the Self.

Renunciation is the essence of Gita.

Renunciation from all actions - is impossible while living (18:11-12). Even a Sannyasin (ascetic) still has to act. Gita promises a way to Moksha even while living an active life.

#### Main Yogic paths

1. **Karma yoga:** Renunciate self-centered action. Engage in selfless service (2:47).
2. **Karma yoga:** Renunciate attachment to the fruits (rewards/punishment) of actions (2:47).
3. **Bhakti Yoga:** Surrender every action and possession in Love (and devotion) to God (11:52-55, 12:2, 18:59-60, 18:65-66).
4. **Raja Yoga:** Meditate (6:10-15)
5. **Jnana Yoga:** Seek spiritual knowledge and wisdom (4:36-38)

Point (1) is not just outwards altruism out of some selfish motivation (even if to indulge in one's own sense of self-importance of being a generous giver) but purely out of a sense of obligation and goodwill.

Point (2) doesn't mean you don't keep a goal in mind - but it is being unmoved with however the outcome turns out (whether in or against your favor) i.e. serving diligently towards some goal (ideally selfless and altruistic) but not clinging to this goal. This is close to Stoic Wisdom of doing what you can do to the best of your ability but not worrying about the result - because beyond what you have done, how the exact outcome turns out is not up to you - so no point worrying over it.

From Gandhi (taken from the introduction of the book):

> "By detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure, your means correct. Really, it means that things will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him."
>
> “But renunciation of fruit,” Gandhi warns, in no way means indifference to the result. In regard to every action one must know the result that is expected to follow, the means thereto, and the capacity for it. He who, being thus equipped, is without desire for the result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfillment of the task before him, is said to have renounced the fruits of his action.

Doing (2) removes anxiety and instantly provides peace and in face may help us being better at doing what we do. Metaphysically it's also purported to take one beyond affects of Karma (4:19-23).

> This attitude frees us completely. Whatever comes – success or failure, praise or blame, victory or defeat – we can give our best with a clear, unruffled mind. Nothing can shake our courage or break our will; no setback can depress us or make us feel “burned out.” Clearly, as the Gita says, “Yoga is skill in action” (2:50). (from introduction)

Point (3) could be effectively the same as point (1). Acting in service of God could just be acting in service of the world at large - for the sake of all sentient beings selflessly (Since God is in the heart of all (10:20)).&#x20;

> Krishna puts this most beautifully in the famous verses of Chapter 9 which begin, “Whatever you do, make it an offering to me” (9:27). Do it, that is, not for personal reward but out of love for the Lord, present in every creature. “Whatever you eat, whatever worship you perform, whatever you give, whatever you suffer”: everything is to be done and given and endured and enjoyed for the sake of the Lord in all, not for ourselves (from introduction)

Gita also says that the path of action and knowledge is ultimately the same (5:4-5).

Meditation can be helpful to build discipline, stillness, inwardness, devotion etc. if they are lacking.

Gita ranks different Yogas differently in different chapter taking the perspective of different Yogi. Probably better to just do all the yoga in an integrated fashion.&#x20;

#### Meditation Guide

1. Sit in a straight posture to prevent drowsiness
2. Concentrate one-pointedly on a single object (perhaps the position between the eyebrows) free from expectations and attachment to material possessions (6:10-15,8:9-10)
3. Set God/Self as the only goal (6:10-15).

#### Other tips:

1. Rejoice in renunciation (16:1-4)
2. Achieve singleness of purpose - the purpose of Self/God-realization (2:41).
3. Maintain equanimity (even-mindedness) towards all things (2:47, 12:13-14).
4. Reshape yourself through the power of Will (6:5) as needed.
5. Be moderate (middle path) (6:16-18).
6. Remember the Godhead during death (8:5-8,8:12-16).
7. Be friendly, compassionate, gentle, forgiving, upright, pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled; cultivate vigor, patience, will, goodwill, and purity (12:13-14, 13:7,16:1-4).
8. Renounce harm, anger, lust, greed, hypocrisy, ill-will, cruelty, ignorance, arrogance, conceit, malice, and pride (12:13-14, 16:1-4, 16:21)
9. Detach from sense-objects (13:8)
10. Abandon identification and conceit - "I"/"mine" (12:13-14)
11. Enjoy solitude - seek only God with undivided devotion (13:9-11)

#### Mantra During Offerings

Om Tat Sat

> 23 Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat when performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26 Sat means “that which is”; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. (17:23-26)

### Orientation of Yogic Masters

It also serves as a supplement to the previous sections - showing the ideal virtues to be cultivated.&#x20;

1. Maintain holy indifference (2:52-53) (not necessarily apathetic) and equanimity (evenness of mind) in pain and pleasure, success and failure, in the dance of gunas, in the hot and cold etc. (2:14-15, 2:57)
2. Lack ill-will, aggression, anger, etc (2:56).
3. See themselves in all and all in them (2:55).
4. Seeing God and their own Self in everyone - they are not compelled to harm others (12:13, 13:27–28, 16:4). Others' sorrow and happiness are like their own (6:32).
5. Peaceful by ending sorrow - abiding in the wisdom of Self. No longer seek happiness from the world (2:65, 3:17, 5:22-24).
6. Renounce selfish desires (2:71-72).
7. Overcome doership. Don't see themselves as the doer. The true Self is not an actor according to Sankhya philosophy and Gita (5:8-9, 5:14).

### Tripartite Forces of Prakriti

Anything in prakriti, according to GIta (following Sankhya), is a mixture of three "Gunas" (forces) with one guna always predominant:

1. Tamas is frozen energy, the resistance of inertia.
2. Rajas is active energy; it is like a swollen river, full of uncontrolled power.
3. Sattva is harmony; it can be compared with steam when its power is harnessed.

> Guna means strand, and in the Gita the gunas are described as the very fabric of existence, the veil that hides unity in a covering of diversity.&#x20;
>
> * Tamas is maya’s power of concealment, the darkness or ignorance that hides unitive reality;
> * rajas distracts and scatters awareness, turning it away from reality toward the diversity of the outside world.&#x20;
>
> Thus the gunas are essentially born of the mind. When the mind’s activity is stilled, we see life as it is. (from introduction)

Gunas as levels of consciousness:

1. Tamas - collective unconscious - a chaotic dumping ground of mental residues, constitutive of basic animal drives and appetites - similar to storehouse consciousness in Yogicara.&#x20;
2. Rajas - ordinary mind - incessant stream of thoughts; desiring, worrying, resenting, scheming, competing, frustrating, and getting frustrated. Rajas is power released but uncontrolled and egocentric.
3. Sattva - higher mind - controlled - equanimous - not a state of repressive regulation, but the natural harmony that comes with unity of purpose, character, and desire

(The above texts are adapted from the introduction)

May have some similarities to Plato's Tripartite division of soul. Also see: [https://blisscredo.com/plato-ethics-bhagavad-gita-morals-3-amazing-similarities/](https://blisscredo.com/plato-ethics-bhagavad-gita-morals-3-amazing-similarities/)

Gunas as personality factors:

1. Tamasic person - ignorant, drowsy, confused, infatuated, intoxicated, indifferent, sluggish etc.
2. Rajasic person - passionate, selfish, engaged in desiring, worrying, anxiety, anger, compeition, fustration etc. (can still have a clear perspective, deliberative and calculative compared to Tamasic people)&#x20;
3. Sattvic person - controlled, equanimous, harmonious, self-regulated, disciplined, selfless

Persons (by person, I mean the self-prakriti bound entity as a whole rather than Purusha) too are mixtures of the three gunas. Different persons can have different gunas as predominant. Gunas can be thought of as different types of personality dispositions.

Gunas bind the Self to the body

Chapter 14:

> 6 Sattva – pure, luminous, and free from sorrow – binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom.
>
> 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action.
>
> 8 Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep.

The master transcending the gunas unbinds oneself even from happiness (14:22-23).

The Purusha transcends the gunas - since gunas are parts of Prakriti (not Purusha).&#x20;

#### Evolution of Gunas:&#x20;

Sattva is better than Rajas, which is better than Tamas. It is recommended to first evolve one's gunas from Tamas to Rajas and then to Sattva.

Sattva > Rajas > Tamas

Ultimately, all the gunas has to be transcended - the true Self transcends the gunas (13:12-15)- since gunas are only part of the prakriti (and the Self is ultimately beyond it).

> First tamas must be transformed into rajas – apathy and insensitiveness into energetic, enthusiastic activity.&#x20;
>
> But the energy of rajas is self-centered and dispersed; it must be harnessed to a higher ideal by the will. Then it becomes sattva, when all this passionate energy is channeled into selfless action. This state is marked by happiness, a calm mind, abundant vitality, and the concentration of genius.&#x20;
>
> But even this is not the end. The goal of evolution is to return to unity: that is, to still the mind. Then the soul rests in pure, unitary consciousness, which is a state of permanent joy.
>
> (from introduction)

#### Tripartite Orientations

Each gunas is associated with different sets of dispositions and overall 'Sradhanas' (meaning: "what's placed in heart" - a system of values and beliefs). The predominance of a guna manifests in particular ways in varies contexts (eg. actions, motivations ). Since Sattvic people are considered to be more virtuous than Rajasic people, who are considered to be more virtuous than Tamasic people -- their corresponding orientations can also serve as moral guidance (signifying how to be closer to being a Sattvic person)

Food preferences:

> 8 Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy – food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10 Tamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. (17:8-10)

Others:

Sattvic people do selfless deeds in good faith out of obligation and goodwill. Rajasic people outwardly may appear to do selfless deed but upon selfish motivations - eg. for reputation, praise, respect, or feeding into one's sense of grandiosity. Tamasic people are confused and lack perspective. And so on. (see Chapter 17)

Gunas and knowledge

> 20 Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22 Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. (18:20-22)

Gunas and nature of happiness - only sattvic people can have long-term happiness (although may seem like poisonous in the beginning). Rajasic activities may provide some initial happiness but ends up being poisonous in the long-term. Happiness of tamasic people is delusion.&#x20;

> 36 Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end – this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39 Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. (18:36-39)

### Death and Rebirth

1. The master can remain calm during death. Progressively getting into subtler and subtler states, withdrawing their consciousness from the senses - they can meditate out from the head into the union (and thus moksha) (8:12-16)

> Such a person, the Upanishads stress, can actually shed the body voluntarily when the hour of death arrives, by withdrawing consciousness step by step in full awareness. Some of the Gita’s most fascinating verses, for those who can interpret them, are Krishna’s instructions on how to die (8:12–13). (from Introduction)

> At this stage of the death process an ordinary person has no access to the will; but it is just here that prana, with conscious awareness, must be made to move upwards to the head. If prana leaves the body through the brahmarandhra, there will be no rebirth: that is, the dying person will enter samadhi at the time of death. In samadhi, prana is withdrawn from lower levels of awareness to rush upwards to the seventh center at the crown of the head. This is possible only for the yogi who has thoroughly mastered meditation and the control of prana. (from commentary)

Guna and rebirth:

> 14 Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. 16 The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. (14:14-16)

2. Sattvic people may incarnate in the worlds of the wise ones (see above).
3. "demonic" and selfish people - who do things out of self-importance and lack belief in morality, God or anything - gets into downward spirals. Lust, greed, and anger are three gateways to hell (16:16-20).

### Sacred Duty

1. Gita also presents a sort of caste system. Each caste is associated with certain duties and dispositions (18:40-44).
2. Anyone from any caste can achieve perfection (Gita doesn't seem to explicitly discriminate among the castes as superior vs inferior) by doing their duties (18:45-46).
3. Gita doesn't seem to espouse any sort of social caste inheritance from family explicitly.
4. It suggests that one should do the duty one is born with (which could refer to some form of natural dispositions rather than social or cultural inheritance) (18:47-48). One's dispositions would compel or lean towards completing the relevant duties (18:59-60).
5. It's better to do one's own duties than others' (3:35, 18:47-48).
6. This possibly leans toward a ["true will/Great work"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Work\_\(Thelema\)) style philosophy.

### Critiques

The idea of inactive Self untouched by action don't make much sense. That would make the Self - causally transcendent. Then how can the "Self" be even bound? Such a Self can't be bonded or free - the spiritual path would be meaningless. Moreover, if the Self is action-less - in other words, causally impotent, how can we even speak about it? This is just the traditional [issue](https://people.duke.edu/\~fd13/2014/De\_Brigard\_2014\_JoCS.pdf) of [epiphenomenalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epiphenomenalism/). For any discriminating mind to be sensitive to the presence of Self, the Self have to have some causal effect to be sensitive about.

I had a mystical experience where it did phenomenologically seemed like I was a passive Witness - unmanifest - standing behind the phenomena of mind and matter - wherein everything happens on its own (even thinking appears just like external objects arising and passing away) - me - "The Witness" not doing anything other than witnessing.&#x20;

But now, I think it was partly illusory. Causation itself is a rather elusive concept and phenomenologically too - it's hard to pin down (just see [Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9662/9662-h/9662-h.htm)). It seems to me ordinary the mind tries to frame the world in terms of a causal model - projecting events in terms of causal rules (elements of these ideas are present in [Hume](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9662/9662-h/9662-h.htm), [Kant](https://www.amazon.com/Critique-Reason-Cambridge-Works-Immanuel/dp/0521657296/)). This causal model is ordinarily also associated with a self-model ([Metzinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self\_model)) that is associated with a self as a controller and source of causal enaction. But this is only a form of cognitive projection - an appearance - which can be altered in certain "mystical" states - resulting in another form of appearance. But neither appearance is necessarily the "truth".  The truth is probably somewhat in between.&#x20;

So if it seems like X stands without causing anything, it doesn't mean it is not causing anything - seeming is not reality. This is why it's also unclear how much we can rely on mystical experiences for knowledge - without critical thought - especially given that there seems to be possible to different mystical experiences with mutually contradicting seemingness.&#x20;

Moreover, I suspect that the hard distinction of Purusha-Prakriti separation is itself somewhat suspicious and artificial (and generally seems to be rejected in Advaita Vedanta, too). I had another "mystical experience" closer to Buddhism - where Purusha as a transcendent witnessing ground appeared superfluous - the phenomenal experience appeared just as objective events unfoloding with the quality of manifestedness - do we really require a "Self"? Can't there be "just the seen in the seen"?&#x20;

### Referred Quotes

> When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! (2:14-15)

> The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. (2:23)

> Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many- branched and endless. (2:41)

> You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself – without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:47)

> When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. (2:52-53)

> They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. (2:55)

> 56 Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. (2:56)

> Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. (2:57)

> there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. (2:65)

> They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of “I,” “me,” and “mine” to be united with the Lord. This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality. (2:71-72)

> But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. (3:17)

> It is better to strive in one’s own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following one’s own dharma, but competition in another’s dharma breeds fear and insecurity. (3:35)

> Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. (3:19-20)

> Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish attachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. (4:10-11)

> The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and content with whatever comes to them. They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. (4:19-23)

> 36 Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. (4:36-38)

> The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. (5:4-5)

> Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, “I am not the doer.” While seeing or hearing, touching or smelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. (5:8-9)

> Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. (5:14)

> 22 Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. (5:22-24)

> Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. (6:5)

> 10. Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions.
> 11. Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass.
> 12. Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified.
> 13. Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering.
> 14. With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal.
> 15. With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. (6:10-15)

> 16 Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union (6:16-18)

> 32 When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. (6:32)

> 6 In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. 8 Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. 10 My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory of the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. (7:6-11)

> 5 Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. (8:5-8)

> The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in the center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. (8:9-10)

> Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. (8:12-13)

> I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15 Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. (8:14-16)

> But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. (8:20)

> 4 I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5 Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. 7 At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8 Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. (9:4-9)

> “I am the Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence” (10:20).

> 32 I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. (11:32)

> 52 It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me. (11:52-55)

> 2 Those who set their hearts on me and worship me with unfailing devotion and faith are more established in yoga. (12:2)

> 13 That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of “I” and “mine” and of pleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self- controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me – with such as these I am in love. (12:13-14)

> 5 The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. (13:5)

> 7 Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. (13:7)

> 8 Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. (13:.8)

> 9 Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. 11 This is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. (13:9-11)

> the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor non-being. 13 It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. 15 It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. (13:12-15)

> 19 Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. 21 Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. 22 Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. (13:19-22)

> 26 Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. (13:26)

> 33 As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal. (13:33-34)

> They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. (13:27–28)

> 29 They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. 31 This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. (13:29-32)

> 3 My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. (14:3-4)

> 22 They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. 23 They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within themselves and do not vacillate. (14:22-23)

> 16 In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. 18 I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. (15:16-19)

> Be fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your dedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self- controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the truth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in renunciation. 2 Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be compassionate and gentle; show good will to all. 3 Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride. Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. (16:1-4)

> 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell.
>
> 17 Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. 19 Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20 Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. (16:16-20)

> 21 There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three. (16:21)

> 11 As long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12 Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. (18:11-12)

> 13 Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. (18:13-15)

> 40 No creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different responsibilities found in the social order – distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra – have their roots in this conditioning. 42 The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. 43 The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. (18:40-44)

> 45 By devotion to one’s own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing one’s own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. (18:45-46)

> 47 It is better to perform one’s own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. (18:47-48)

> 57 Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. (18:57-58)

> 59 If you egotistically say, “I will not fight this battle,” your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. (18:59-60)

> 65 Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. (18:65-66)
