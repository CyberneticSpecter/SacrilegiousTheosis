### Self-Image Creation

1. Create an image of your current self - honestly representing your current mental state of affairs.
2. Create an image of your target "ideal" self - as a goalpost and a regulative ideal.&#x20;

Memory improvement can help oneself gain inner stability - by helping better retain one's goal, maintaining focus, and making oneself more integrated and self-aligned.&#x20;

### Journaling&#x20;

1. Write a vision statement for clarity - what you want to do, what you want to achieve truly, etc.&#x20;
2. Keep a dream journal - can provide insights for life and may help develop memory in general.
3. Physical journaling could be better for retaining memories.

### Meditation

Practice Meditation to improve memory, mental stability, and inner bliss.

### Breathwork

Pendulum Breathing - use it for focus, relaxation, and memorization.

Inhale, hold & focus (or memorize/create mental images), exhale

### Mnemonics

Use as applicable.

Create abbreviations, associate stories, images, etc., to help memory.

Example:

* **S**ome **P**eople **H**ave (represent: **s**in $$\theta$$ = **P**erpendicular/**H**ypotenuse ) &#x20;
* **C**urly **B**rown **H**airs (represent: **c**os $$\theta$$ = **B**ase/**H**ypotenuse )
* **T**urned **P**ermanently **B**lack (represent: **t**an $$\theta$$ = **P**erpendicular/**B**ase)

Above is a mnemonic used to remember trigonometric relations (that's the only reason I remember them now).

### Memory Palaces

```
1. Create ~26 memory palaces for use
2. Set a Linear journey through the palace
3. Use simple (labeled) numbers for memory stations
4. Exploit alphabetic associations
```

* Memory Palaces can be any "place" we can mentally construct and walk through (visually, non-visually, perhaps with a notebook, whatever - dependent on where you fall or not fall regarding aphantasia and such). These places would be ideal already in our memories - e.g., childhood room, the current apartment room, some university classroom, office room, someplace in nature, etc. It can even be a place from dreams.&#x20;
* Jot down the memory palaces in a notebook/journal.
* In a memory palace, there should be "memory stations" - different key areas - for example, in a bedroom - the bed, the toilet in the bathroom, the hanging wrack, the clothes in them - whatever.&#x20;
* We can associate items (to remember) with these memory stations. We can exploit alphabetic associations (similarity in the names of the place/station and the item) for easier memory associations. &#x20;
* Set a protocol for "officially" walking through the palace - determining a linear order from one station to another in the memory palace.&#x20;
* Associate an image to each station - perhaps images related to the item you want to memorize. Make the images animated and exaggerated. Need not be "pictures" - use other modalities if you have aphantasia.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
General advice for mnemonic utilization: don't memorize new information to memorize/encode other information. (Create associations using existing memories!)
{% endhint %}

### Deep Multimodal Encoding: KAVE COGS

KAVE-COGS:&#x20;

```
K - Kinesthetics 
A - Auditory 
V - Visual 
E - Emotional 

C - Conceptual 
O - Olfactory 
G - Gustatory (taste) 
S - Spatial
```

Use all modalities of imagination to empower memory retention - while reading, while using memory palaces, whatever.

### Big Five of Learning

Big 5 of Learning:

1. Reading
2. Listening
3. Speaking
4. Writing
5. Remembering

### Recall Rehearsal

For practicing remembering:

Rehearse recalling from memory palace encodings in various orders:

* Start to finish
* Finish to start
* Center to start
* Center to finish
* Periodic skips
* Random

(This helps undermine the [serial positioning effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position\_effect))

* Review a lot (make multiple memory palace journeys if applicable). Used Spaced Repetition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced\_repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced\_repetition)
* Create exaggerated magnetic images.
* Memorize scriptures (e.g., Hindu scriptures in Sanskrit) -> deep internalization of scriptures; serve as practice of memorization abilities; can generate bliss.
* To remember numbers, associate them with letters - which can be further associated with events involving Persons, actions, and objects.

### Feynman Technique

Take ELI5 notes.
