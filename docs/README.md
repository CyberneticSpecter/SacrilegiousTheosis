# Introduction

### About the Website

[https://sacrilegious-theosis.gitbook.io](https://sacrilegious-theosis.gitbook.io/sacrilegious-theosis/)

I am using the website as a sort of ["digital garden"](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and a [personal knowledge base](https://towardsdatascience.com/personal-knowledge-graphs-9a23a0b099af)/[second brain](https://towardsdatascience.com/personal-knowledge-graphs-9a23a0b099af) of mine. It includes two main sections:

1. Study Notes
2. My Books

&#x20;**Study Notes**

In this section, I organize notes about things I am studying (as an autodidact). Topics can include philosophy, science (cognitive science, neuroscience, biology, physics, computer science, etc.), maths,  self-help, religion, mysticism etc. Currently, the contents are sparse, but I plan to grow them slowly.&#x20;

Currently, I have a bunch of mental notes without a physical correspondent (outside my brain), I have a rag-tag group of notes in different corners (Google Docs, notepad texts in Dropbox, etc.), I have a bunch of [Obsidian ](https://obsidian.md/)notes, and this (Gitbook).

My current plan for note-taking is something like this:

1. Taking active notes while reading stuff in Obsidian. Create summaries and integrate key points near the end of reading a book/article/collection-of-related-articles. This is currently done privately.&#x20;
2. Revisit older materials I have read and older notes - if I find them relevant. Distill them to Obsidian (still private).&#x20;
3. Clean up my notes and publish the main points/summary here in Gitbook publicly (this is public; this is what you get to see here).&#x20;

Ultimately, I should have a private obsidian with "dirty" notes and further distilled "cleaner" notes publicly in Gitbook (here).&#x20;

But a few points about my Gitbook notes:

1. &#x20;They are not necessarily "good" summaries in the sense of best representing the book/paper being summarized. They are closer to "personalized" summaries - focusing on elements that are salient to me for whatever reason. So, I may not mention many things from the book/paper, even if they are a big part of them and even if nothing is wrong with them.
2. I may include some personal thoughts, critiques, etc., besides a summary.
3. I don't necessarily "endorse" anything  I write about in the study notes. I may even precisely jot down things that I disagree with and later write some critique on.&#x20;
4. While I said I would post "cleaned" versions of my Obsidian notes, it will keep it relatively low-effort and terse. It may not be always understandable. Still, I will strive to keep them somewhat digestible and potentially useful for the public. &#x20;

**My Books**

In this section, I am planning to work on books. These will be long-term projects (nothing much has been done yet) - you will probably not see much in this section in the near term.&#x20;

I explain the current topic that I am working on here:

{% content-ref url="my-books/the-struggle-with-goodness/drafts/draft-1/chapters/chapter-1-introduction.md" %}
[chapter-1-introduction.md](my-books/the-struggle-with-goodness/drafts/draft-1/chapters/chapter-1-introduction.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Broadly, I am looking to build a personal (which need not turn out to be anything new, strictly speaking) systematic philosophy spanning broad areas - epistemology, logic, metaphysics, phenomenology, free will, self, ethics, politics -- the question of ethics "what one ought to do (if anything)" being the guiding central question.&#x20;

My current plan for the book is:

1. Initially, write a "bad" book with little research/study on science and philosophy. Given my current knowledge and understanding, I want to "think for myself" and muster the best I can write on this topic in the initial draft. Currently, my mind is internally disorganized, with many vague ideas - here and there. I want to organize them, meditate on them, push them against each other, aiming towards a reflective equilibrium, and write down my struggles on "digital paper" (in [draft-1](my-books/the-struggle-with-goodness/drafts/draft-1/ "mention")).  This should also help me better contextualize new information in my further studies.
2. Following that, I would potentially update the initial "bad" book as my research and study progress or as my writing skill/taste changes. Even if I don't change my mind, I may still update the contents to better contextualize them against the existing literature (discussing who agrees with me, engaging with those who disagree, etc.). I also wish to train and investigate the phenomenology of meditative states such as [jnanas](https://www.amazon.com/Jhana-Consciousness-Buddhist-Meditation-Neuroscience/dp/1645470806) and the implementation of practical policies besides just "book knowledge".&#x20;
3. Ideally, this will be a "living book" updated throughout my lifetime. &#x20;
4. Unlike the study notes, I plan to be more articulate in the books and talk more transparently about my own personal stance and thoughts.&#x20;

I plan to have the book go through three main stages. See more here:

{% content-ref url="my-books/the-struggle-with-goodness/status.md" %}
[status.md](my-books/the-struggle-with-goodness/status.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

In a way, writing the book is primarily meant to serve as a means to achieve a higher level of personal integration of the knowledge gathered through my readings. Still, hopefully, it can also be helpful or interesting to others.&#x20;

After sufficient research, I may write books on other, more specific topics.&#x20;

### Version Control and Feedback

I am synching the Gitbook with this public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CyberneticSpecter/SacrilegiousTheosis). All the changes made can be publicly viewed through the repository's commit history. If you have some feedback/comment, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/CyberneticSpecter/SacrilegiousTheosis/issues) in the repository. You can also email [me](https://github.com/CyberneticSpecter).

I also plan to record substantial updates with corresponding dates on the page below:

{% content-ref url="miscellaneous/updates.md" %}
[updates.md](miscellaneous/updates.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This can be a quick way to check "what's new". Although, I may not record every edit there (for that, see the GitHub repository).

### **About Me**&#x20;

For now, I will keep myself anonymous but may deanonymize myself someday. But a little bit about my educational background: I am a PhD candidate studying computer science, specializing in Natural Language Processing. So, primarily, I am a STEM student. However, I have studied multiple philosophy books/papers (not all cleanly organized into notes here at the moment) and have also taken a few (400-500 level) university courses on analytic philosophy. Although I am a computer science student, do not expect much of computer science-related topics. It is mainly a philosophy-focused knowledge base.&#x20;

<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Also, I used to be /u/Nameless1995 on Reddit (a flaired contributor in [r/askphilosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/) and active in r/consciousness), but I deleted myself - because I was a bit too active. So if anyone knows me from there and wants to contact me, you know how to. I also used to host a comics series called "philosophy suicides" on wordpress. But I deleted it because I wrote them in my late teenage years - and it is not something I am too proud of anymore due to a severe lack of philosophical nuance.&#x20;
