* Seek Purity of Heart - Happiness without harm
* Take faith in awakening - as a "working hypothesis" to test out (not purely a blind faith)
* The framing of self-questions is problematic - it leads to mental proliferation and suffering.

> The Buddha, however, noted that the thought, “I am the thinker” lies at the root of all the categories and labels of conceptual proliferation, the type of thinking that can turn and attack the person employing it. These categories are notoriously hard to pin down, often dissolving into arbitrary semantics. “Do I exist?”—It depends on what you mean by “exist.” “Do I have a self?”—It depends on what you mean by “self.” Thinking driven by definitions like these often falls prey to the hidden motives or agendas behind the definitions, which means that it’s unreliable.

* Four categories of Appropriate Attention (attention attuned to suffering and four noble truths):

1. “This is suffering (the Pali word dukkha here covers stress and pain as well)”&#x20;
2. “This is the origination of suffering”&#x20;
3. “This is the cessation of suffering”
4. “This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.”

* No one approach:

> Even within a particular category, there’s no one approach that works in all cases. In one of his discourses Buddha observes that some unskillful mental states wither away if you simply watch them with equanimity, while others require an active effort to take them apart. In another discourse he expands on this observation by recommending five ways of dealing with distracting thoughts: replacing them with more skillful thoughts, focusing on their drawbacks, consciously ignoring them, relaxing the tension that goes into maintaining them, and forcefully suppressing them. In neither discourse, though, does he give hard and fast rules for telling which type of thought will respond to which approach.

* All desires are ultimately desires for happiness-satisfaction

> You want an iPod, a sexual partner, or an experience of inner peace because you think it will make you happy. A desire to climb a mountain focuses on a different set of hungers—for accomplishment, exhilaration, self-mastery—and appeals to a different image of satisfaction.

* Skillful desire - leads to stable happiness; unskilful desires - those that don't.

> Whatever the desire, if the solution actually leads to happiness, the desire is skillful. If it doesn’t, it’s not. However, what seems to be a skillful desire may lead only to a false or transitory happiness not worth the effort entailed. So wisdom starts as a meta-desire: to learn how to recognize skillful and unskillful desires for what they actually are.

* Be on the lookout for stress even in concentration states.

> Once you’ve mastered a state of concentration, see where it still contains elements of stress. Then look for patterns to that stress: what are you doing to cause it? Find ways to gladden the mind when it’s down, to liberate it from its confinements, to steady it when it gets restless

* Acts of virtue, generosity, concentration, etc., produce relatively stable-secure happiness. But happiness "beyond change" is in the "deathless" (something transcendental beyond space-time) accessing which requires awakening, non-identification, and cultivation of the factors of awakening.&#x20;

> The first possibility is in fact the case: whatever is constant is easeful; the Deathless is actually the ultimate ease. But the second possibility isn’t a skillful way of regarding what’s constant: if you latch onto what’s constant as self, you’re stuck on your attachment. To go beyond space and time, you have to go beyond fabricating the producing and consuming self, which is why the concluding insight of the path is: “All dhammas”— constant or not—“are not-self.”

**Personal Critique:** The deathless as some transcendental "changeless" happiness makes little sense. If it is really changeless, there would be no one truly unhappy - there can't be a transition from an "unhappy" state to a "happy" state in deathless. One could counter that the deathless is not absent ever but merely "obscured" by mental defilements, but if the "happiness" is "hidden," it doesn't really make much sense to call it happiness in the first place. In essence, at the very least, the "deathless" state appears contingent if not on a positive condition, then on a negative condition - i.e., absence of mental defilements (fuels of passion).&#x20;

* Questions dissolve in the deathless.

> All consuming and producing for the sake of your own happiness comes to an end, for a timeless wellbeing has been found. And because all mind-objects are abandoned in this happiness, questions of constant or inconstant, stress or ease, self or not-self are no longer an issue.

* Buddhism in the West gets mixed up with Romanticism - ideas of integration, wholeness, oneness, interdependence - often seen positively within Romantic ideals. Interdependence is not necessarily positive in Buddhism; it's an inter-feeding relation - not something to celebrate. The Buddhist answer to questions like "What is my true identity?" is not "all is one. interdependent" or such but a rejection of the question as ill-conceived.&#x20;
* Forgiveness - unburdening oneself from ill will, thoughts of vengeance, anger, etc. Reconciliation - return to amicability and trust - going over and beyond forgiveness. They should be separated. One can forgive without reconciling - given the lack of fundamental values or rational reasons not to trust.
* Three steps to reconciliation:

1. Acknowledgment of wrongdoing.
2. Acknowledgment of the wrongdoing as a genuine offense.
3. Promise to restrain oneself from repeating the offense.

> Pervading these instructions is the realization that genuine reconciliation cannot be based simply on the desire for harmony. It requires a mutual understanding of what actions served to create disharmony, and a promise to try to avoid those actions in the future. This in turn requires a clearly articulated agreement about —and commitment to—mutual standards of right and wrong. Even if the parties to a reconciliation agree to disagree, their agreement needs to distinguish between right and wrong ways of handling their differences.

* Strong concentration is necessary for insight. Insight without concentration is "just concepts."
* Insight into a state of concentration requires sticking with the state for a long time.&#x20;
* "The best state of concentration for the sake of developing all-around insight is one that encompasses a whole-body awareness."

Wrong Concentrations:

> There were two exceptions to Ajaan Fuang’s usual practice of not identifying the state you had attained in your practice, and both involved states of wrong concentration. The first was the state that comes when the breath gets so comfortable that your focus drifts from the breath to the sense of comfort itself, your mindfulness begins to blur, and your sense of the body and your surroundings gets lost in a pleasant haze. When you emerge, you find it hard to identify where exactly you were focused. Ajaan Fuang called this moha- samadhi, or delusion-concentration.

> The second state was one I happened to hit one night when my concentration was extremely one-pointed, and so refined that it refused settle on or label even the most fleeting mental objects. I dropped into a state in which I lost all sense of the body, of any internal/external sounds, or of any thoughts or perceptions at all —although there was just enough tiny awareness to let me know, when I emerged, that I hadn’t been asleep. I found that I could stay there for many hours, and yet time would pass very quickly. Two hours would seem like two minutes. I could also “program” myself to come out at a particular time.

> In both these states of wrong concentration, the limited range of awareness was what made them wrong. If whole areas of your awareness are blocked off, how can you gain all-around insight? And as I’ve noticed in years since, people adept at blotting out large areas of awareness through powerful one-pointedness also tend to be psychologically adept at dissociation and denial. This is why Ajaan Fuang, following Ajaan Lee, taught a form of breath meditation that aimed at an all-around awareness of the breath energy throughout the body, playing with it to gain a sense of ease, and then calming it so that it wouldn’t interfere with a clear vision of the subtle movements of the mind. This all-around awareness helped to eliminate the blind spots where ignorance likes to lurk.

Ideal Concentration

> An ideal state of concentration for giving rise to insight is one that you can analyze in terms of stress and the absence of stress even while you’re in it. Once your mind was firmly established in a state of concentration, Ajaan Fuang would recommend “lifting” it from its object, but not so far that the concentration was destroyed. From that perspective, you could evaluate what levels of stress were still present in the concentration and let them go. In the initial stages, this usually involved evaluating how you were relating to the breath, and detecting more subtle levels of breath energy in the body that would provide a basis for deeper levels of stillness. Once the breath was perfectly still, and the sense of the body started dissolving into a formless mist, this process would involve detecting the perceptions of “space,” “knowing,” “oneness,” etc., that would appear in place of the body and could be peeled away like the layers of an onion in the mind. In either case, the basic pattern was the same: detecting the level of perception or mental fabrication that was causing the unnecessary stress, and dropping it for a more subtle level of perception or fabrication until there was nothing left to drop.

* Nirvana is not a place

> But nirvana is most emphatically not a place. It’s realized only when the mind stops defining itself in terms of place: of here, or there, or between the two.

> Even if the “there” is an infinite sense of awareness grounding, surrounding, or permeating everything else, it’s still limited, for “grounding” and so forth are aspects of place. Wherever there’s place, no matter how subtle, passion lies latent, looking for more food to feed on.

* Nirvana is unestablished consciousness/Consciousness without surface&#x20;

Note: this is controversial:&#x20;

> The second point is that nirvana, from the very beginning, was realized through unestablished consciousness—one that doesn’t come or go or stay in place. There’s no way that anything unestablished can get stuck anywhere at all, for it’s not only non- localized but also undefined

> Because the consciousness-aggregate covers only consciousness that is near or far, past, present, or future—i.e., in connection with space and time—consciousness without surface is not included in the aggregates. It’s not eternal because eternity is a function of time.

* Nirvana as a verb:

> With no here or there or between the two, you obviously can’t use the verb “enter” or “reach” to describe this realization. Maybe we should make the word nirvana into a verb itself: “When there is no you in connection with that, you nirvana.” That way we can indicate that unbinding is an action unlike any other, and we can head off any mistaken notion about getting “stuck” in total freedom.
