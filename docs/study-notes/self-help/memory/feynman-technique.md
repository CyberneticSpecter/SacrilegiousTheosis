# Feynman Technique



1. **Select & Study:** Select a topic/concept to study and study it.
2. **ELI5**: Teach what you learned to a child - or simulate the process - e.g. use a mental model of a child as a target audience for writing notes. Use plain (jargon-free) words, and be concise.&#x20;
3. **Fill-in-the-Gaps:** Identify your gaps when doing 2 (e.g. where you cannot quite go behind jargon) ; study more to fill in those gaps; revise the notes as necessary.
4. **Simplify:** See if you can further simplify your ELI5 notes after (1-3). Review, organize, and cycle through 2-4 as necessary. &#x20;
