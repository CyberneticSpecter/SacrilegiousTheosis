# The Little Book of Common Sense Investing

Notes from [The Little Book of Common Sense Investing - John C. Bogle](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing/dp/1119404509)

* Index fund good
* Don't underestimate compounding
* Stock market as a whole a zero-sum game.
* Trading generally leads to worse return.
* More motion, less chance of returns
* P/E ratio = no. of dollars investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings
* Greed/hope = high-moderate P/E; fear = low P/E
* Short term speculative return - unstable; long term - stable; emotional volatility dissolves in the long term.
* beware of hidden end compounding cost
* Tax is another cost
* Managed fund tax inefficient - can have more internal movements and cost
* Short term past performance can be noisy random signals that can regress to the mean
* Fund cost can be a good indicator. Lower the better.
* Not all index funds are the same. Choose the lowest cost ones from reputable organizations
* Low costs also good indicators for bonds and money market funds.

***

**Bonds:** Fixed-income securities.

* Some principal (Face Value/Par Value) debted to corporation/government/municipalities etc.
* The debtor pays some amount regularly (at the "coupon date") based on an agreed interest rate (coupon rate) for some X years.
* After the X years (maturity date) the original principal is paid back.
* Issue price - the original price of the bond (not always par value -- sometimes discount may be offered or be at a premium)

***

* "New index funds" based on weighing based data mining (instead of market cap based weighing as in traditional index) the past are ultimately not indexes but active management. They can have similar costs and issues. They are suspicious.
* ETF - Wolf in sheep's clothing - diversification in narrow sectors, high turnovers

***

**Index Funds vs ETFs:** Index funds can be ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) or index mutual funds. ETFs tend to be passive but some are actively managed. ETF offer more flexibility in trading - intraday trading, margin trading etc. ETFs could be more tax efficient.

* Research for value investing may not be as viable in modern times.
* Index funds - diverse, low cost, tax-efficient
* Hold index bonds too -- learn about bond

**Bogle's Strategy:** Hold bond percentage according to age e.g. 20 percent when you are 20 years old. Bond more secure less risk. Better for older age.
