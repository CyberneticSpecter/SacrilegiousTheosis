# Non-Zero Days

From: [https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/comment/cdah4af/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/comment/cdah4af/)

### Four Rules

**(1) Non-Zero Days**

Remove "zero" days (days where you do "nothing" towards your goal). Take at least one step for your habit/goal, etc., every day.

**(2) Gratitude and Favors**

Have gratitude for good things done by past you, and do favors for future you.&#x20;

> Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? **fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me.** I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero).

**(3) Forgive Yourself**
