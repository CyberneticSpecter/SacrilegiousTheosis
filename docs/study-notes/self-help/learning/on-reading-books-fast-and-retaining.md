# On Reading Books Fast and Retaining

Tips from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpIrzA2ohcg)

1. Books can have fluff and info not relevant to you.
2. Start from a top-down perspective - e.g., a summary (SparkNotes, ChatGPT), zero in on relevant information based on a table of contents as necessary, and have a high-level perspective by looking around page sections before getting in. Fast scanning may also allow better knowledge of which information may be redundant or repeated elsewhere.&#x20;
3. Approach info like a curator - ask if it is relevant/new or fluff/known-stuff (can be skipped) -- be ruthless.
4. Then, be a connector - synthesize the curated information
5. Exercises for retaining information:
   1. Review (ask is this new? is this relevant)
   2. Debate, be a professor (Feynman technique ([feynman-technique.md](feynman-technique.md "mention")) essentially)&#x20;
   3. Ask about relevance to future you.
6. Note-taking could be harmful (IDK about that) -- offloads knowledge outside the brain, and active note-taking or simply copying quotes may distract from immersively studying.&#x20;

In addition:

1.  Sleep/rest may be essential for retaining information - synthesizing it, and building memories.&#x20;

    See [1](https://teaching.fsu.edu/tips/2020/10/02/rest-is-essential-for-learning-productivity/), [2](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-shows-how-taking-short-breaks-may-help-our-brains-learn-new-skills).
2. Create a sacred space (could be an imaginary bubble - specific environments like a library may also help) -- associate it with focus (when out of focus, move out of the space). See [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe-iBysIb7o).
   1. Natural light is better for focus.
   2. Keep the working space clean.
3. Use high-intensity exercises during breaks; there is no need for hard timers (Pomodoro) - if you cannot focus, take a break; if you are getting into the zone, go on - be flexible  (also from 3).
