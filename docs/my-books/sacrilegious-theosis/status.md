I plan to have the book go through three main stages:

<table><thead><tr><th width="114">STAGES</th><th width="143">START</th><th>END</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stage 1</td><td>The beginning of the website.</td><td>Completion of writing the initial draft (with little to no research). Initially the book would be probably not very good.</td></tr><tr><td>Stage 2</td><td>After the end of Stage 1</td><td>When enough revisions have been made after background study and research such that I am moderately "satisfied". </td></tr><tr><td>Stage 3</td><td>After the end of Stage 2</td><td>End of the universe. </td></tr></tbody></table>

Each stage may involve continual revision.

Currently, we are at **Stage 1**.&#x20;
