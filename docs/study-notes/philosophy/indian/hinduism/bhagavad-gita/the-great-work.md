# The Great Work

Source: [The Great Work of Your Life - Stephen Cope](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/13573312)

### Introduction

A book about finding and executing one's "dharma" - sacred vocation or duty (one's "calling")- similar to Crowley's True Will. Meeting the challenge of dharma brings true satisfaction.

**Definition:**

> René Guénon, in his classic Introduction to the Study of Hindu Doctrines, comes as close as any author to the meaning of dharma as we will use it here. “Dharma,” he says, “is the essential nature of a being, comprising the sum of its particular qualities or characteristics, and determining, by virtue of the tendencies or dispositions it implies, the manner in which this being will conduct itself, either in a general way or in relation to each particular circumstance.”

> The word dharma in this teaching, then, refers to the peculiar and idiosyncratic qualities of each being—those very essential and particular qualities that make it somehow itself.

**Formula**:

1. Look to your dharma
2. Do it full out!
3. Let go of the fruits.
4. Turn it over to God/Nature

### Look to Your Dharma

* Trust in the gift.
  * Your gift is not necessarily your dhamma but likely related to it.
  * A life of self-betrayal -- avoiding one's dhamma -- is deadening.
  * Overcome doubt (the invisible affliction), leading to paralysis and procrastination. Embrace your dharma - own it.
*   Think of the small as large.

    * Don't try to be bigger than you are.
    * "Be humbly who you are,” - Thoreau

    > "See yourself as a grain of sand,” suggests Chögyam Trungpa, the Tibetan crazy-wisdom guru, “see yourself as the smallest of the small. Then you can make room for the whole world.

    * You can't be anyone but yourself. Your fundamental idiosyncratic qualities that define your dharma are not as easily manipulated as we think. Dharma is to be discovered rather than created.
    * A superficially simple life lived wisely can still be effective.
* Listen for the call of the times.
  * Dharma can be fluid and dynamic.
  * Listen to the need of the moment.
  * Be prepared to change your vocation based on the call of the moment.
  * Perform selfless actions

> Dharma is born mysteriously out of the intersection between The Gift and The Times. Dharma is a response to the urgent—though often hidden—need of the moment. Each of us feels some aspect of the world’s suffering acutely. It tears at our hearts. Others don’t see it or don’t care. But we feel it. And we must pay attention. We must act. This little corner of the world is ours to transform. This little corner of the world is ours to save.

### Do it Full Out!

* Find out who you are and do it on purpose.
  * Bringing forth what is within you is mostly about creating the right conditions.
* Unify!
  * Forget self - let the work take over - let "my work" become "the work"
  * Happiness from service.
  * Say "no" to the unessential (renunciate, simplify, adopt ruthless minimalism).
  * Create unity of action and focus.
* Practice deliberately.
  * See [expert-performance.md](../../../../skills/learning/deliberate-practice/expert-performance.md "mention")
  * Train attention.
  * Mastery brings pleasure.

### Let go of the fruits.

* Work without expectation of reward.
* Be alike (equanimous) in both success and failure.
* Grasping for rewards disturbs and obscures the mind; it hinders one's work and dhamma.

> “When you keep thinking about sense objects,” he says, “attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste.”

* Grasping exacerbates the sense of duality and separation.
*   How can one follow dharma without any desire/grasping?:

    * Initially, yogi tried to eliminate all desires via asceticism, but that ended all the good stuff as well (does it really?)
    * Next, the yogi discovered that desires are compound, and there can be a good "salutary" part as well - "aspiration" for Self-realization - this can be teased apart from craving/clinging.
    * Aspiration is used for dhamma
    * Teasing apart aspiration from clinging/craving is slippery - it's a lifetime goal.



    > Aspiration, as it turns out, is full of energy. Full of resolve. Full of a deep ardency for the realization of the Self. It is this very aspiration that leads us to search for truth. For beauty. For our full humanity. He \[Endymon] enters what Keats called “the Cave of Quietude,” a retreat into the depths of consciousness. In quiet retreat and contemplation, Endymion realizes that success and failure are not the measure of life. He sees the way in which both light and shade, success and failure, and praise and blame, are all parts of life. He sees, even, the ways in which beauty can be revealed through sorrow, and through life’s losses. **He decides to choose complete surrender to the endless richness of the moment, whatever the moment brings. He decides to embrace both sides of life—the light and the shadow.** This was a pivotal moment in the development of Keats’s creative consciousness.



    * Consider the working out of dharma as soul-making.
    * Surrender to the greater impersonal



    > “That which is creative must create itself.” He discovered, as all great artists do, that there was something impersonal at work. Something at work that was not him. And to surrender to this larger force gave him a new kind of freedom and a new sense of faith in the process itself.



    * Achieve Immortality through the soul's outpour
    * Develop negative capability - Ability to be with uncertainties. mysteries, doubt - requires surrender
    * Develop disinterestedness - “not for Fame and Laurel, but from the mere yearning and fondness I have for the beautiful even if my night’s labours should be burnt every morning and no eye ever shine upon them.” - Keats
* Find dhamma in difficulties:

> The great Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche called this experience of aversion to the aversion “the pain of pain.” Pain is inevitable, of course. And aversion is a natural response to it. But aversion to the aversion? This is not inevitable, as it turns out. This part is optional. And the kicker: The aversion to the aversion is where the real suffering lies

> And what do you find at the heart of fear, dread, loathing, anger, hatred? You find a surprise. You find a gift.

> Marion did the unusual. She decided to take cancer as her new dharma. She walked the razor’s edge: She did not declare war on it. She invited it in to see what she could make of it, and to see what it would make of her. She opened to the possibility that this experience could transform her in salutary ways.

> Stand at the center and embrace death with your whole heart. Then you will endure forever.

> She wrote in her journal: “When \[God] is moving you toward a new consciousness, you need to recognize the winds of change at once, move with them instead of clinging to what is already gone.”

* Integrate with your shadow:

> Marion discovered an underlying theme in her clients’ dreams. She discovered that her addicted clients lived divided lives—lives split between body and soul, between perfection and imperfection, between light and dark. Healing came about through integrating these “pairs of opposites.” She came into an understanding of the way in which longing for our idealized images of life separates us from our true selves and from our true callings.

> “Blessed is the man who, having subdued all his passions, performeth with his active faculties all the functions of life, unconcerned about the event … Be not one whose motive for action is the hope of reward. Perform thy duty, abandon all thought of the consequence, and make the event equal, whether it terminate in good or evil; for such an equality is called yoga.

### Turn it over to God/Nature

Thou art that:

> Arjuna,” he says (and I paraphrase), “the explosion of energy and consciousness you have just beheld is also within you. Coiled and ready. Thou Art That. If only you would connect with it. You saw all beings in me. All beings are also in you.” Krishna continues, and says, in eect: “Now seeing the whole picture, you have the information you need in order to make your decisions about how to act in this world. You now know, incontrovertibly, that the whole world is in every being. You have now seen that you are One with it all. You have seen that the whole world is one family. There is no true separation between beings. This is the Truth.

You are not the doer:

> Your dharma is your way of staying connected with your True Nature. It is the particular way in which you can devote your life to the welfare of all beings. Your dharma is your very own way of expressing the Truth. Your dharma is the one place where you can penetrate the fleeting world of form. **Where you can live as I live, fully connected with the whole world of mind and matter. Where you can live in the sure knowledge that you are not the Doer, but only a vehicle of the great Doer.**

Surrender:

> Surrender your life’s work to God—to the divine within you, and to the divine within all beings. In this way your forgetfulness and delusion will slowly disappear. When you are immersed in your dharma, the wave becomes the sea again. Don’t you see? Dharma is your path home.
>
> “Now do you see?” says Krishna. “In this mortal life you must walk by faith. You must walk by faith, not by the sight of your limited human vision. In order to walk by faith, you must gradually learn to trust me and my guidance. You must gradually learn to surrender your will. You cannot steer your dharma with the vehicle of self-will—the will of the small “s” self. Self-will will always steer you toward delusion, toward forgetfulness, toward separation. This self-will—driven by the grasping of small “s” self—is the greatest enemy of freedom and Oneness.”"

*   Walk by faith

    * Trust in moment-to-moment divine guidance.
    * Suspend personal plans.
    * Method
      1. Ask (pray) for guidance - possibly repeatedly, even beg.
      2. Listen for response - actively (through intuition, hunch, etc.) be on the lookout for signs.
      3. Check out the response. Talk about it with friends and mentors. True "divine" response will survive testing out.
      4. Wait to act - Once you do begin to get clarity, wait to act until you have at least a kernel of inner certitude.
      5. Once there is “a flavor of certitude,” says Bede, then “pray for the courage to take action.”
      6. “Let go of the attempt to eliminate risk from these decisions and actions.” Risk cannot be eliminated, and attempting to eliminate it will only lead you back to paralysis.
      7. “Move forward methodically.” Begin to take action in support of your choice. Be aware that you are led by faith and not by sight and that the whole process may be shrouded in darkness. Learn to feel your way along.
      8. “Let go of the outcome.” Let go of any clinging to how this all comes out. You cannot measure your actions at this point by the conventional wisdom about success and failure.
    * Non-doership:



    > Says Krishna: “Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, I am not the Doer.
*   Turn yourself to Zero

    *   Four Pillars of Gandhi's transformation from being a coward - by deliberate practice of Gita - turning oneself to zero:

        1. Mantra Meditation (name of Rama)
        2. Gita - as a reference book
        3. Systematic cultivation of energy
           1. Control of diet - abandon recreational diet - focus on effect. Mainly vegetables and milk. Eating as a spiritual practice.
           2. Vigorous walking as daily exercise.
           3. Freeing energy by renunciation - progressive simplification and minimalism.
        4. Selfless service

        > Gandhi grasped the paradox: The more he gave away, the more he had. “He who devotes himself to service with a clear conscience, will day by day grasp the necessity for it in greater measure, and will continually grow richer in faith … If we cultivate the habit of doing this service deliberately, our desire for service will steadily grow stronger, and will make not only for our own happiness but that of the world at large.”
    * See the world as self. Love the world as self.
    * Zeroing out



    > Gandhi came to believe that any power he might have to affect the world only emerged when he got himself out of the way, and let God do the work. He came to call this “reducing yourself to zero.” “There comes a time,” he wrote in the peak of his maturity, “when an individual becomes irresistible and his action becomes all- pervasive in its effects. This comes when he reduces himself to zero.”

    * Spirit of ahimsa



    > Because he wants nothing for himself, the true satyagrahi is not afraid of entering any conflict for the sake of those around him—and he enters it without hostility, without resentment, without resorting even to violent words. In the face of the fiercest provocation, he never lets himself forget that he and his attacker are one. This is the true spirit of ahimsa, or “nonviolence.” But ahimsa is more than just the absence of violence: It is the presence of justice and of love. Gandhi always made it perfectly clear that “the satyagrahi’s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrongdoer.”
    >
    > ***
    >
    > Greater courage is required of the satyagrahi,” he often said, “than the run- of-the mill soldier with a gun in his hand. Any coward can be brave when holding a rifle.

Parting words:

> We work first because we have to work. Then because we want to work. Then because we love to work. Then the work simply does us. Difficult at the beginning. Inevitable at the end.

### Epilogue

Don't be bogged down by the will to be great or the will to do everything

> We are not called to everything. We are just called to what we’re called to. It is inevitable that authentically good parts of ourselves will not be fulfilled. What a relief. “We can do no great things,” wrote the nineteenth-century French saint, Teresa, “only small things with great love.” Thomas Merton—who struggled through his whole life with his longing to be considered a great author—writes of this: “… we cannot achieve greatness unless we lose all interest in being great. For our own idea of greatness is illusory, and if we pay too much attention to it we will be lured out of the peace and stability of the being God gave us, and seek to live in a myth we have created for ourselves. It is, therefore, a very great thing to be little, which is to say: to be ourselves. And when we are truly ourselves we lose most of the futile self-consciousness that keeps us constantly comparing ourselves with others in order to see how big we are.”

Craftsmanlike view of life

> These great exemplars of dharma each took a craftsmanlike view toward life: Do your daily duty, and let the rest go. Poke away systematically at your little calling. Tend the garden a little bit every day. You do not have to exhaust yourself with great acts. Show up for your duty, for your dharma. Then let it go.

### Critique

* How is doubt an affliction to abandon and also something we ought to be comfortable with by having "negative capability"?
* Dharma seems to be sometimes framed as related to natural dispositions, sometimes related to the will of "God" - with a supernatural element in how to find "guidance" -- and then somehow it's also present when everything goes wrong - in which case we just face and endure difficulties or (forcibly?) try to find "meaning"? It feels like trying to do everything and effectively being nothing. For example - even if every decision turns out terrible in some irreversible way, the author could just say, "Yeah, you can make facing those difficulties your dharma". At that point, it feels like "anything goes as dharma" -- it then seems more like a psychological framing to deal with life.
* The author seems to suggest that the "divine guidance" needs to be talked out -- suggesting consensus/approval of others (friends/mentor) is a sign of it being really "divine" - yet in other anecdotes, people carried out their "dharma" by doing things that others were not very keen on (e.g., Frost's painting journey). Also doesn't seem to have grounding in Gita.
* I wonder what the author's source is on separating "aspiration" from desire.
* The problem with anecdotes is [survivorship bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/survivorship-bias). There could be plenty of stories where people tried out what is recommended but didn't turn out well.
* I'm not sure about the relevance of shadow work to Gita.
