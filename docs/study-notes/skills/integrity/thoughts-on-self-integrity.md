### Self-Integrity is Self-Honesty

Honesty about values, honesty in actions (alignment with values and belief), honesty in keeping promises (commitments), honesty in thought and investigation (Truth as a regulative ideal)

Violation of Integrity is a seed of self-dissonance, chaos, and self-destruction.

Self-Integrity:

* Alignments of values, actions, and dispositions.
* Cognitive harmony, coherence.
* Ability to follow through commitments to yourself
* Authenticity

> What is this magical habit, you ask? Well, your _self-integrity_ of course. In other words, your ability to follow through on your commitments to yourself.

### Self Integrity - Feedback Loop

* Can both become a vicious cycle or a virtuous cycle
* Do more of what you committed to -- becomes easier -- increase self-trust
* Doing less of what you committed to -- becomes harder -- decreases self-trust

> When you repeatedly set intentions and don’t follow through on them, you’re teaching your subconscious that your commitments to yourself don’t matter. As a result you lose trust in yourself, just like you wouldn’t trust an unreliable friend who never shows up to your coffee date.

* Beliefs determine actions, but our actions (and habits) also determine our beliefs - tell us who we are.
* Under performative contradiction/cognitive dissonance, we try to escape the friction by changing beliefs or action policies. Changing belief can involve losing trust in oneself - degrading one's self-image ==> downward spiral.

### 7 Tips

1. Write commitments on paper (set "binding vows" perhaps)
2. Start super small to train
3. Get married to calendar
4. Treat commitments like meetings
5. Put yourself first
6. Embrace resistance (start training with small moments of resistance)
7. Know your tendency (e.g. consider external accountability)

### Future Self-Continuity And Integrity

> This self is vague and fuzzy—just a concept. It doesn't _feel like us_. So we make decisions now that hurt that future self as though it is not really us, but a stranger.

> This phenomenon is so common that psychologists have a name for it. They call it low **future self-continuity**.

Lack of future self-continuity == unethical

> Recently, psychologists have also discovered that a lack of future self-continuity can cause us to hurt others. A dysfunctional relationship with our future self makes us more likely to lie, bribe, cheat, and make false promises. **In other words, when we lack future self-continuity, we also lack integrity.**

Imagine, think concretely, and connect.

> Use imagination exercises to help you consider your future self in concrete detail. Hershfield and his colleagues had participants write about how they would remain similar to their current selves in ten years' time. But in another study, he and his colleagues created a virtual reality environment where participants looked at an older avatar of themselves as though in a "a virtual mirror."

> The point is not which technology you use, but rather whether you feel similar to your future self, and how vividly and positively you view that future self. When you imagine yourself in 10 or 20 years, does it really _feel like you_ you're imagining? Do you feel hopeful and positive about this future self? Does this future self share your likes, beliefs, values, and ideals? It's helpful to think concretely about what will your future self's main concerns and activities will be.
