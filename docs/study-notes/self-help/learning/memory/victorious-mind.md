# Victorious Mind

#### Self-Image Creation

1. Create an image of your current self - honestly representing your current mental state of affairs.
2. Create an image of your target "ideal" self - as a goalpost and a regulative ideal.&#x20;

#### Journaling&#x20;

1. Write a vision statement for clarity - what you want to do, what you want to achieve truly, etc.&#x20;
2. Keep a dream journal - can provide insights for life and may help develop memory in general.
3. Physical journaling could be better for retaining memories.

#### Meditation

Practice Meditation to improve memory, mental stability, and inner bliss.

#### Breathwork

Pendulum Breathing - use it for focus, relaxation, and memorization.

Inhale, hold & focus (or memorize/create mental images), exhale

#### Mnemonics

Use as applicable.

Create abbreviations, associate stories, images, etc, to help memories.

Example:

* **S**ome **P**eople **H**ave (represent: **s**in $$\theta$$ = **P**erpendicular/**H**ypotenuse ) &#x20;
* **C**urly **B**rown **H**airs (represent: **c**os $$\theta$$ = **B**ase/**H**ypotenuse )
* **T**urned **P**ermanently **B**lack (represent: **t**an $$\theta$$ = **P**erpendicular/**B**ase)

Above is a mnemonic used to remember trigonometric relations (that's the only reason I remember them now).

#### Memory Palaces

* Create 26 memory palaces for use
* Set a Linear journey through the palace
* Simple (labeled) numbers as memory stations
* Exploit alphabetic associations

Visualize in memory palaces. Make it animated and exaggerated.
