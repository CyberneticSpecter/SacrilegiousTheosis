# Integrity of Emptiness

From [The Integrity of Emptiness](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/integrityofemptiness.html) - Thanissaro Bhikkhu

### Summary

1. Act wisely (reflectively) - Advice to Rahula
2. Driving principles - Honesty and Compassion. Loss of honesty -> slippery slope to self-deception, loss of integrity, loss of ability to perceive feedback or grow in wisdom. Compassion to end all suffering -> drive for practice.
3. "no-self" is a wise choice at some point. Self-view is stress.
4. Wisdom of action-purification - deflect judgments of good and bad and tangles of "selfing" - instead focus on actions and consequences -- see what's mistaken, what to correct, take healthy joy in what's done right. Act without conceit ("I am"-ness) -- view in terms of action and consequences rather than "self"
5. Three types of Emptiness:
   1. Emptiness as meditation - release from stress and fabrications.
   2. Emptiness as insight into the no-self attribute of things.
   3. Emptiness as concentration - samadhi after release from disturbances.

Simple test for Wisdom:

> For all the subtlety of his teachings, the Buddha had a simple test for measuring wisdom. You're wise, he said, to the extent that you can get yourself to do things you don't like doing but know will result in happiness, and to refrain from things you like doing but know will result in pain and harm.

The metaphysical concept of emptiness (of inherent existence) not necessarily useful

> Instead, the phrase "Buddhist wisdom" conjures up teachings more abstract and paradoxical, flying in the face of common sense — emptiness being a prime example. Emptiness, we're told, means that nothing has any inherent existence. In other words, on an ultimate level, things aren't what we conventionally think of as "things." They're processes that are in no way separate from all the other processes on which they depend. This is a philosophically sophisticated idea that's fascinating to ponder, but it doesn't provide much obvious help in getting you up early on a cold morning to meditate nor in convincing you to give up a destructive addiction.

### **Observing Everyday Actions**

* Purify actions

> It's "action-purification." You deflect judgments of good and bad away from your sense of self, where they can tie you down with conceit and guilt. Instead, you focus directly on the actions themselves, where the judgments can allow you to learn from your mistakes and to find a healthy joy in what you did right.

* Make mindful, reflective decisions

Must be honest about issues, actions, consequences, motives - moral integrity is a precondition for wisdom

> First and foremost, it forces you to be honest about your intentions and about the effects of your actions. Honesty here is a simple principle: you don't add any after-the-fact rationalizations to cover up what you actually did, nor do you try to subtract from the actual facts through denial. Because you're applying this honesty to areas where the normal reaction is to be embarrassed about or afraid of the truth, it's more than a simple registering of the facts. It also requires moral integrity. This is why the Buddha stressed morality as a precondition for wisdom, and declared the highest moral principle to be the precept against lying. If you don't make a habit of admitting uncomfortable truths, the truth as a whole will elude you.

* Lying to others is a slippery slope to self-deception, which, in turn, perturbs wisdom.

### Three Emptiness

1. Emptiness as Meditation Approach (MN 121)
2. Emptiness as Attribute (non-self of all phenomena) (SN 35.85)
3. Emptiness as State of Concentration

#### First Emptiness

> In fact, this sort of emptiness simply takes the instructions Rahula received for observing everyday actions and extends them to the act of perception within the mind.

* Empty of disturbances

> Emptiness as an approach to meditation is the most basic of the three kinds of emptiness. In the context of this approach, emptiness means "empty of disturbance" — or, to put it in other terms, empty of stress.

* Release from Fabrication

> Finally, seeing that even this objectless concentration of awareness is fabricated and willed, he drops his desire to continue mentally fabricating anything at all. In this way he is released from the mental fermentations — sensual desire, becoming, views, ignorance — that would "bubble up" into further becoming. He observes that this release still has the disturbances that come with the functioning of the six sense spheres, but that it's empty of all fermentation, all potential for further suffering and stress. This, concludes the Buddha, is the entry into a pure and undistorted emptiness that is superior and unsurpassed. It's the emptiness in which he himself dwells and that, throughout time, has never been nor ever will be excelled.

***

Meditation on emptiness is reflective action (perception as action) - percieving based on harm and consequences (disturbance is subtle harm)

> Here, the action is the perception that underlies your state of meditative concentration. You settle into the state by repeating the action of perception continually until you are thoroughly familiar with it. Just as Rahula discovered the consequences of his actions by observing the obvious harm done to himself or to others, here you discover the consequences of concentrating on the perception by seeing how much disturbance arises from the mental action. As you sense disturbance, you can change your mental action, moving your concentration to a more refined perception, until ultimately you can stop the fabrication of mental states altogether.

***

Two principles - honesty and compassion

> The first is honesty: the ability to be free of embellishment or denial, adding no interpretation to the disturbance actually present, while at the same time not trying to deny that it's there. An integral part of this honesty is the ability to see things simply as action and result, without reading into them the conceit "I am."

> The second principle is compassion — the desire to end suffering — in that you keep trying to abandon the causes of stress and disturbance wherever you find them. The effects of this compassion extend not only to yourself, but to others as well. When you don't weigh yourself down with stress, you're less likely to be a burden to others; you're also in a better position to help shoulder their burdens when need be. In this way, the principles of integrity and compassion underlie even the most subtle expressions of the wisdom leading to release.

#### Second Emptiness

> Whereas emptiness as an approach to meditation focuses on issues of disturbance and stress, emptiness as an attribute focuses on issues of self and not-self. And whereas emptiness as an approach to meditation starts with tranquility, emptiness as an attribute starts with insight.

No self as strategy:

> In our desire for happiness, we repeatedly engage in what the Buddha calls "I-making" and "my-making" as ways of trying to exercise control over pleasure and pain. Because I-making and my-making are actions, they fall under the purview of the Buddha's instructions to Rahula. Whenever you engage in them, you should check to see whether they lead to affliction; if they do, you should abandon them.

> However, as meditation refines your sensitivity, you begin to notice the subtle levels of affliction and disturbance that I-making and my-making can create in the mind. They can get you attached to a state of calm, so that you resent any intrusions on "my" calm.

* Phenomena simply as stress arising and passing away

> &#x20;When you remove labels of "I" or "mine" even from your own insights and mental states, how do you see them? **Simply as instances of stress arising and passing away — disturbance arising and passing away** — with nothing else added or taken away. As you pursue this mode of perception, you're adopting the first form of emptiness, as an approach to meditation.

#### Third Emptiness

Application of Second Emptiness Insight

> The third kind of emptiness taught by the Buddha — as a state of concentration — is essentially another way of using insight into emptiness as an attribute of the senses and their objects as a means to attain release.

> &#x20;If he can observe this stress as it arises and passes away simply on its own terms, neither adding any other perceptions to it nor taking anything away, he's again adopting emptiness as an approach to his meditation. By dropping the causes of stress wherever he finds them in his concentration, he ultimately reaches the highest form of emptiness, free from all mental fabrication.

### The Wisdom of Emptiness

> &#x20;Whether they interpret emptiness as meaning empty of disturbance (suffering/stress) or empty of self, whether they encourage fostering insight through tranquility or tranquility through insight, they all culminate in a practice that completes the tasks appropriate to the four noble truths: comprehending stress, abandoning its cause, realizing its cessation, and developing the path to that cessation. Completing these tasks leads to release.

Focus on action and consequence without conceit ("I am")

> Every aspect of the training is purified by viewing it in terms of actions and consequences, which helps to develop the integrity that's willing to admit to unskillful actions, and the mature goodwill that keeps aiming at consequences entailing ever less harm, disturbance, and stress.

> The reason for this is so obvious that it's often missed: if you're going to put an end to suffering, you need the compassion to see that this is a worthwhile goal, and the integrity to admit the suffering you've heedlessly and needlessly caused throughout the past.
