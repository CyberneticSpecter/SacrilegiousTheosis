Notes from: [Ulladu Narpadu - Ramana Mahashri](https://ropeandsnake.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/ulladu-narpadu-with-supplement.pdf)

> Unless Reality exists, can thought of it arise? Since, devoid of thought, Reality exists within as Heart, how to know the Reality we term the Heart? To know That is merely to be That in the Heart.

> Under whatever name or form we worship It, It leads us on to knowledge of the nameless, formless Absolute. Yet, to see one’s true Self in the Absolute, to subside into It and be one with It, this is the true Knowledge of the Truth

(Just) Be "Reality". To know it is to just be it.

> Since we know the world, we must concede for both a common Source, single but with the power of seeming many. The picture of names and forms, the onlooker, the screen, the light that illumines - all these are verily He.

Seems (below) to be a reference to the [Unity of consciousness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/)/Transcendental Unity of Apperception (TUA) - given that we can know - the multimodal aspects of consciousness within a single knowing

**Critique:** but does it justify belief in universal monism over and beyond the existence of a "personal" unity of consciousness?

> The World is true’; ‘No, it is a false appearance’; ‘The World is Mind’; ‘No, it is not’; ‘The World is pleasant’; ‘No, it is not’ - What avails such talk? To leave the world alone and know the Self, to go beyond all thought of ‘One’ and ‘Two’, this egoless condition is the common goal of all.

Go beyond thoughts of one and many

> The body is made up of the five sheaths; in the term body all the five are included. Without the body the world is not. Has one without the body ever seen the world?

Appearance of the world conditioned on the body

> The world is made up of the five kinds of sense perceptions and nothing else. And those perceptions are felt as objects by the five senses. Since through the senses the mind alone perceives the world, is the world other than the mind?

**Critique:** Sounds close to solipsistic reasoning.

> Though the world and mind rise and fade together, the world shines by the light of the mind. The ground whence the world and mind arise, and wherein they set, that Perfection rises not nor sets but ever shines. That is Reality.

Reality (Self?) is the ground of the "appearing" world and mind (which are interdependent - rising and falling together) - the ground actuality (Self-Reality) remains ever unarisen and unfallen.

> True Knowledge is being devoid of knowledge as well as ignorance of objects. Knowledge of objects is not true knowledge. Since the **Self shines self-luminous**, with nothing else for It to know, with nothing else to know It, the Self is Knowledge. Nescience It is not.

> The Self that is Awareness, that alone is true. The knowledge which is various is ignorance. And even ignorance, which is false, cannot exist apart from the Self. False are the many jewels, for apart from gold, which alone is true, they cannot exist.

Self claimed to be self-luminous. Self claimed to be Awareness.

> Under whatever name or form we worship It, It leads us on to knowledge of the nameless, formless Absolute. Yet, to see one’s true Self in the Absolute, to subside into It and be one with It, this is the true Knowledge of the Truth

It seems to reference the "[pure consciousness event](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/#PureConsEven')" - "consciousness without objects but luminosity nevertheless." Its ontological significance is questionable, though.

> Without us there is no time nor space. If we are only bodies, we are caught up in time and space. But are we bodies? Now, then and always - here, now and everywhere - we are the same. We exist, timeless and spaceless we.

hmm...sounds pretty close to what Thanissaro refers to as "deathless" while trying to frame it as contra-brahmanic schools and their "eternalist" selves.

> The debate, ‘Does free will prevail or fate?’ is only for those who do not know the root of both. Those who have known the Self, the common source of freewill and of fate, have passed beyond them both and will not return to them.

hmm..... possibly oversimplistic

> When scriptures speak of ‘seeing the Self’ and ‘seeing God’, what is the truth they mean? How to see the Self? As the Self is one without a second, it is impossible to see it. How to see God? To see Him is to be consumed by Him.

It is impossible to see the Self (it's not an object of experience but the ground of experience). Seeing God is to be consumed by God/Self.

**Critique:** seems to contradict prior claims about self being self-luminous - in other words - self-illuminating - that would seem to suggest it appears to itself. It thus can be "seen" broadly understood.&#x20;

> Without turning inwards and merging in the Lord - it is His light that shines within the mind and lends it all its light - how can we know the Light of lights with the borrowed light of the mind?

Need to turn inwards and merge in the Lord/God to know the Light (of consciousness?) behind personal lights of the mind.

> The body says not it is ‘I’. And no one says, “In sleep there is no ‘I’.” When ‘I’ arises all (other) things arise. Whence this ‘I’ arises, search with a keen mind.

Search the "I" -- looking for it results in losing it - losing it - results in self-realization.

> To say ‘I do not know myself’ or ‘I have known myself’ is cause for laughter. What? Are there two selves, one to be known by the other? There is but One, the Truth of the experience of all.

But why does knowing oneself require there to be two selves? Just a while ago, the author said Self is "self-luminous".

> If we think we are the body, then to tell ourselves, ‘No, I am That’, is helpful to abide as That. Yet - since ever we abide as That - why should we always think, ‘I am That?’ Does one ever think, ‘I am a man’?

No need to think "I am that" to abide in "That"

> If we are the doers of deeds, we should reap the fruits they yield. But when we question, ‘Who am I, the doer of this deed?’ and realise the Self, the sense of agency is lost and the three karmas slip away. Eternal is this Liberation.

> Thoughts of bondage and of freedom last only as long as one feels, ‘I am bound’. When one inquires of oneself, ‘Who am I, the bound one?’ the Self, Eternal, ever free, remains. The thought of bondage goes; and with it goes the thought of freedom too.

But this can't be an ontological shift, right? - since the Self is as it ever is according to the philosophy? So what is it? Merely an epistemic shift?  - a reframing of one's position in the world. But that makes the soteriology sound weaker.&#x20;
