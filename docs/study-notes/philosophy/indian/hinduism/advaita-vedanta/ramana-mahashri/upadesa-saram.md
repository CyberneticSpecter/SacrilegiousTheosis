1. Know the Self through introversion - inward meditation

> "It is true wisdom For the mind to turn away From outer objects and behold Its own effulgent form."

1. Perform disinterested action - surrender action to "God". Otherwise, actions leave behind seeds for actions - no Moksha.
2. Abide in the Self - the heart of being - this is all Yoga (action, devotion, knowledge, Raja) in unison
3. Destroy the 'mind'

> Absorption is of two sorts; Submergence and destruction. Mind submerged rises again; Dead, it revives no more.&#x20;
>
> ***
>
> Breath controlled and thought restrained, The mind turned one-way inward Fades and dies.

4. Knowing the Self is being it. In Self, there is no "I."

> "Where this ‘I’ notion faded Now there as I–I, arises The One, the very Self, The Infinite."
>
> "The Self is defined as that in which there is no I-concept, no concept of a ‘me’. This can only be realised non-verbally through practice and direct experience."
>
> "To know the Self is but to be the Self, For it is non-dual. In such knowledge One abides as that."
>
> "Beyond bondage and release, Is steadfastness In service of the Lord."
