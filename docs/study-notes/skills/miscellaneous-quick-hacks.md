# Miscellaneous Hacks

1. **Meta Self-Control:**  Expect self-control failures and intervene early when possible. eg. stop from starting to watch a TV series since switching mid-way is difficult …. strategically design experiences to have fewer temptations. More [here](https://riikkaiivanainen.medium.com/the-secret-life-of-people-with-high-self-control-its-easier-than-you-think-7dd26fb5282c).
2. Change scenes, stand, **move around** - cheat fatigue (stand 50%, 25% sit, 25% walk). Somewhere from [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/@riandoris).
3. **Minimize multi-tasking**. Focus on the task in the present. Somewhere from [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/@riandoris).
4. When taking breaks - **stare at walls** or something equivalent - "bore yourself" so that "boring things" that you have to do appear more interesting relatively. Somewhere from [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/@riandoris). Also, consider high-intensity exercises during breaks (from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_7vM5wEUz\_s); also see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9189701/)) with some meditation/wall-staring before getting back.
5. **Hinge Creation:** create "hinges" throughout the day when you do certain critical activities (e.g., sleep) on which everything else hangs  (for example, bad sleep - can ruin the rest of the day or make it much less productive). Set <= 6 "alarms" for hinges for specific critical activities that you want to develop as habits and maintain consistently (e.g., morning meditation, workout, sleep). Each hinge can also denote a "phase shift" for your work pattern. For more, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hApnn1vnWi0).
6. Place **Implementation Intention**: “I will exercise for at least 30 minutes on \[DATE] in \[PLACE] at \[TIME].” i.e., very specific intentions. More: [https://jamesclear.com/akrasia](https://jamesclear.com/akrasia)
7. Use [**Funnel Method**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_7vM5wEUz\_s) - start day with the most important task for a few hours - then go lower.&#x20;
8. Remove friction for stuff you want to do; increase friction for stuff you don't want to do. Manipulate the environment to control friction.
9. Jot down any thoughts about actions/tasks to do. Put it in some prioritized list format - eg. [Eisenhower Matrix](https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix) or some personal variation. Free your subconscious from looping over all the things to do.&#x20;
10. Relapse is natural. Don't take it personally - don't make a big deal about it. Remove bad habit cues. Maintain sustained attention/intention. Don't get complacent.
