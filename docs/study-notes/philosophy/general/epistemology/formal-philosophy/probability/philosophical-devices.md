### Constraints

Constraint 1: Basic logical constraints, 0-1 range, Kolmogorov Axioms (Dutch Book Argument)

Constraint 2: The Principal Principle: "An agent's subjective probabilities ought to match the objective probabilities, even if in fact they don't."

Constraint 3: Conditionalization (Belief Update): P\_new(X) = P(X|E)

Constraint 4: Bayes Constraint: P(X|E) = P(E|X)P(X)/P(E)

### Subjective and Objective notions of Probability

Subjective: credence&#x20;

Objective: propensity; radiation, QM, perhaps deterministic chanciness

### **If-then vs. Probability Conditional**

* Controversial relation
* One might think P(C|A) is the relaxed version of "If C then A" (or C=>A), but consider that if-then is true whenever the antecedent is false. But P(A|C) is not 1 if C is 0.

**Indicative conditional:** "If Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, then someone else did."&#x20;

(This type of conditional is about what we should do when we believe p is true -- how should we update our beliefs rationally?)&#x20;

**Subjunctive conditional**: "If Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy, then someone else would have."&#x20;

(This type of conditional is about counterfactual reasoning - it's metaphysical -- about what difference p would have made in history if we remove our current belief to reason about them)

* Some think both bottom out with indicative but controversial

Note to Self: Perhaps we want a different sort of conditional -- to reflect certain usage of conditionals in natural language: A => B is True if B is true whenever A is true, i.e. when Necessary(A->B) And Possible(A)
