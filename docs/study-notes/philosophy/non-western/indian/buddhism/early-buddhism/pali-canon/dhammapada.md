#### Selected Quotes:

Pure moderated mind == happiness. Renunciation == Happiness

> Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow

> The good renounce (attachment for) everything. The virtuous do not prattle with a yearning for pleasures. The wise show no elation or depression when touched by happiness or sorrow.

Settle quarrels

> There are those who do not realize that one day we all must die. But those who do realize this settle their quarrels.

Calibrate action priority

> Those who mistake the unessential to be essential and the essential to be unessential, dwelling in wrong thoughts, never arrive at the essential.

Evil is self-harm

> The evil-doer grieves here and hereafter; he grieves in both the worlds. He laments and is afflicted, recollecting his own impure deeds

> The evil-doer suffers here and hereafter; he suffers in both the worlds. The thought, “Evil have I done,” torments him, and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woe.

> Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm

Need to be energetic; cultivate sustained vigor

> Ever grows the glory of him who is energetic, mindful and pure in conduct, discerning and selfcontrolled, righteous and heedful.

> If anything is to be done, let one do it with sustained vigor. A lax monastic life stirs up the dust of passions all the more.

Be heedful, fear heedlessness

> Do not give way to heedlessness. Do not indulge in sensual pleasures. Only the heedful and meditative attain great happiness

> Mara never finds the path of the truly virtuous, who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledge.

> The monk who delights in heedfulness and looks with fear at heedlessness advances like fire, burning all fetters, small and large.

Must delight in heedfulness, not just struggle:

> Delight in heedfulness! Guard well your thoughts! Draw yourself out of this bog of evil, even as an elephant draws himself out of the mud.

Find fault in oneself; establish oneself in practice before instructing others

> Let none find fault with others; let none see the omissions and commissions of others. But let one see one’s own acts, done and undone.

> One should first establish oneself in what is proper; then only should one instruct others. Thus the wise man will not be reproached.

Be beyond praise or blame; victory and defeat

> Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.

> Victory begets enmity; the defeated dwell in pain. Happily the peaceful live, discarding both victory and defeat.

Immense value of being meditative

> Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.

Hasten to do good

> Hasten to do good; restrain your mind from evil. He who is slow in doing good, his mind delights in evil.

> Speak not harshly to anyone, for those thus spoken to might retort. Indeed, angry speech hurts, and retaliation may overtake you.

> By faith and moral purity, by effort and meditation, by investigation of the truth, by being rich in knowledge and virtue, and by being mindful, destroy this unlimited suffering

Why jubilation?

> When this world is ever ablaze, why this laughter, why this jubilation? Shrouded in darkness, will you not see the light?

Let one not ignore one's own welfare

> Let one not neglect one’s own welfare for the sake of another, however great. Clearly understanding one’s own welfare, let one be intent upon the good.

Avoid Intimacy

> Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved, for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved, both are painful.

> Therefore hold nothing dear, for separation from the dear is painful. There are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unloved.

> From endearment springs grief, from endearment springs fear. From him who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief, whence then fear?

No desire for sexual partners

> For so long as the underbrush of desire, even the most subtle, of a man towards a woman is not cut down, his mind is in bondage, like the sucking calf to its mother

Be moderate, restrain, don't indulge

> Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain, so Mara can never overpower the man who lives meditating on the impurities, who is controlled in his senses, moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort

> Good is restraint in the body; good is restraint in speech; good is restraint in thought. Restraint everywhere is good. The monk restrained in every way is freed from all suffering.

Universal Love

> The monk who abides in universal love and is deeply devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha attains the peace of Nibbana, the bliss of the cessation of all conditioned things.
