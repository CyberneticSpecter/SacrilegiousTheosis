# Teaching the Science of Learning

From: [Teaching the Science of Learning - Weinstein et al. ](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-017-0087-y)

### Retrieval

* Practice recalling/retrieving learned (or even unlearned) topic-relevant information.&#x20;
* Can use tests to practice retrieval.&#x20;
* Retrieving strengthens memory.

### Spaced Practice

* Space out your studying over time (repeat the same information)
* Potentially optimal lag (space between study sessions)- neither too far apart, nor two close

### Interleaving

* Switch between problem types (but overall of a related topic material) of study - mixing study topics/subjects doesn't seem to help.&#x20;
* The line between interleaving and spacing can be blurry.

### Elaboration

* "connecting new information to preexisting knowledge."
* Elaboration can be a broad notion - it can relate to "deeper" thinking on the topic, organizing/synthesizing information, etc.
* The specific form of elaboration with empirical support is **elaborative interrogation**, where the student asks questions like "why" or "how" and answers them. The answers must be checked against reference materials or a teacher (poorly generated answers can hurt learning).&#x20;
* Self-explanation is also empirically supported. [Feynman Technique](feynman-technique.md) probably belongs here, too.

### Concrete Examples

From the paper:

> \[...] using concrete examples to supplement content that is more conceptual in nature can make the ideas easier to understand and remember.&#x20;
>
> Concrete examples can provide several advantages to the learning process:&#x20;
>
> (a) they can concisely convey information,&#x20;
>
> (b) they can provide students with more concrete information that is easier to remember, and&#x20;
>
> (c) they can take advantage of the superior memorability of pictures relative to words (see “Dual Coding”)."

### Dual Coding

* Combining images, words, and other data modalities (or "codes" or "representations), including motor actions, can help to learn.
* Consider drawing (engaging motor functions to create visual representations).
* (Perhaps thinking of a subject from multiple angles, from different author's perspectives, etc., can help too).
* Not much evidence for the benefit of tailoring educational material to a particular "learning style" (as opposed to dual/multi-coding).

Quotes from the paper:

> providing multiple representations of the same information enhances learning and memory, and that information that more readily evokes additional representations (through automatic imagery processes) receives a similar benefit.

> Given that pictures are generally remembered better than words, it is important to ensure that the pictures students are provided with are helpful and relevant to the content they are expected to learn.

> Engelkamp and Zimmer (1984) suggest that motor movements, such as “turning the handle,” can provide an additional motor code that can improve memory, linking studies of motor actions (enactment) with dual coding theory (Clark & Paivio, 1991; Engelkamp & Cohen, 1991; Madan & Singhal, 2012c).

> Wammes, Meade, and Fernandes (2016) demonstrated that **generating drawings can provide memory benefits** beyond what could otherwise be explained by visual imagery, picture superiority, and other memory enhancing effects.
